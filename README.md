## Powered by

This example is powered by the following services:

- Next.js App Router (Framework)
- Vercel Postgres & Prisma (Database)

- Tailwind (CSS Framework)

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Profile pages with a full angel investor profile. Should include all the info in the table + maybe sections like previous investments
- [ ] Download people's images locally so twitter profile pics don't break when they change them
